  abstract = {Using remarkably simple experimental techniques it is possible to
	gently break a metallic contact and thus form conducting nanowires.
	During the last stages of the pulling a neck-shaped wire connects
	the two electrodes, the diameter of which is reduced to single atom
	upon further stretching. For some metals it is even possible to form
	a chain of individual atoms in this fashion. Although the atomic
	structure of contacts can be quite complicated, as soon as the weakest
	point is reduced to just a single atom the complexity is removed.
	The properties of the contact are then dominantly determined by the
	nature of this atom. This has allowed for quantitative comparison
	of theory and experiment for many properties, and atomic contacts
	have proven to form a rich test-bed for concepts from mesoscopic
	physics. Properties investigated include multiple Andreev reflection,
	shot noise, conductance quantization, conductance fluctuations, and
	dynamical Coulomb blockade. In addition, pronounced quantum effects
	show up in the mechanical properties of the contacts, as seen in
	the force and cohesion energy of the nanowires. We review this research,
	which has been performed mainly during the past decade, and we discuss
	the results in the context of related developments.},

	state and the nonmagnetic state, depending on the density of states
	of free electrons, the s-d admixture matrix elements, and the Coulomb
	correlation integral in the d shell; that in the magnetic state the
	d polarization can be reduced rather severely to nonintegral values,
	without appreciable free electron polarization because of a compensation
	effect; and that in the nonmagnetic state the virtual localized d
	level tends to lie near the Fermi surface. It is emphasized that
	the condition for the magnetic state depends on the Coulomb (i.e.,
	exchange self-energy) integral, and that the usual type of exchange
	alone is not large enough in d-shell ions to allow magnetic moments
	to be present. We show that the susceptibility and specific heat
	due to the inner shell electrons show strongly contrasting behavior

	Green’s function method to calculate the electronic structure of
	nanocontacts while the ballistic transmission and conductance eigenchannels
	were obtained by means of the Kubo approach as formulated by Baranger
	and Stone. We demonstrate that the conductance of the systems is
	mainly determined by the electronic properties of the atom bridging
	the macroscopic leads. We classify the conducting eigenchannels according
	to the atomic orbitals of the contact atom and the irreducible representations
	of the symmetry point group of the system that leads to the microscopic
	understanding of the conductance. We show that if impurity resonances
	in the density of states of the contact atom appear at the Fermi
	energy, additional channels of appropriate symmetry could open. On
	the other hand, the transmission of the existing channels could be
	blocked by impurity scattering.},

	upon adsorption onto the surface. This sulfur-terminated Mn12 molecule
	has a total magnetic moment of 18μB in the ground state, in contrast
	to 20μB for the standard Mn12. The Mn12 molecular orbitals broaden
	due to the interaction of the molecule with the gold surface and
	the broadening is of the order of 0.1 eV. It is an order of magnitude
	less than the single-electron charging energy of the molecule so
	the molecule is weakly bonded to the surface. Only electrons with
	majority spin can be transferred from the surface to the sulfur-terminated
	Mn12 since the gold Fermi level is well above the majority lowest
	unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) but below the minority LUMO.
	The amount of the charge transfer is calculated to be 1.23 electrons
	from a one-dimensional charge density difference between the sulfur-terminated
	Mn12 on the gold surface and the isolated sulfur-terminated Mn12,
	dominated by the tail in the electronic distribution of the gold
	surface. A calculation of a level shift upon charging provides 0.28
	electrons being transferred. The majority of the charge transfer
	occurs at the sulfur, carbon, and oxygen atoms close to the surface.
	The total magnetic moment also changes from 18μB to 20μB, which is
	due to rearrangements of the magnetic moments on the sulfur atoms
	and Mn atoms upon adsorption onto the surface. The magnetic anisotropy
	barrier is computed including spin-orbit interaction self-consistently
	in density-functional theory. The barrier for the Mn12 on the gold

  abstract = {Ab initio methods for calculating the adiabatic electronic properties
	of a single isolated molecule interacting with a metal surface are
	reviewed. First the fundamental approaches of Anderson, Grimley,
	and Newns for chemisorption, as well as of Zaremba and Kohn, for
	physisorption, are outlined. Then the density-functional theory and
	its approximations are considered. The different models for the adsorbate
	system are described. They comprise those in which the system has
	a finite volume - i.e., the cluster, the slab, and the supercell
	models - and those which take into account the semi-infinite nature
	of the substrate - i.e., the embedding approach based either on the
	Dyson equation or on Green’s-function matching. Those definitions
	are also introduced that we deem important for the understanding
	of the physical properties of systems to be presented in this article.
	The lack of full screening in a localized region around the adsorbate,
	and hence the existence of long-range Friedel’s oscillations induced
	by the adsorbate in the metal, are discussed. The way in which the
	lack of full screening influences the calculated adsorption energies
	is estimated by the grand-canonical functional. Recent ab initio
	results on physisorption of a noble-gas atom on metals deal mainly
	with the limits of validity of the simpler effective-medium theory
	and with the anticorrugating effect of He. Atomic chemisorption is
	considered in order to deal with the concept of bonding at a metal.
	Dissociative chemisorption calculations mainly treat the H2 metal
	system. Here both the adiabatic electronic properties and the sticking
	probabilities recently obtained using the ab initio potential-energy
	surfaces are analyzed. Carbon monoxide chemisorption, lateral interactions
	between adsorbates, adatom diffusion, and chemisorption on stepped
	surfaces are presented as prototypes of the large variety of ab initio
	results currently available. Finally, the conclusions are devoted
	to the respective merits of the different theoretical approaches

	We observe Coulomb blockaded transport and can resolve the discrete
	energy spectrum of the molecule. We are able to mechanically tune
	the spacing between the electrodes (over a range of 5 ̊) to modulate
	the lead-molecule coupling, and can electrostatically tune the energy
	levels on the molecule by up to 160 meV using a gate electrode. Initial

	of the electrode potential on the surface bonding. The electric field
	affects the corrugation of the PES which decreases for negative fields

	highest relaxation in a direction perpendicular to the surface was
	observed for gold atoms, whereas silver atoms presented the highest
	relaxation in a plane parallel to the surface. The surface relaxation
	is more important in the low coverage limit. The surface bonding

	leads to a strong dependence of the PES with the tilt angle of the
	adsorbate on Au(111) whereas this dependence is less pronounced on
	the other metals. Thus, the adsorbate-relaxation and the metal-relaxation
	contributions to the binding energy are more important on gold. The

	be made to do useful work on atoms? In particular, can an atomic-scale

	to describe qualitatively and semiquantitatively the barrier height

	organic CNL (charge neutrality level) and the interface screening
	includes: (a) charge transfer across the interface; (b) the {"}pillow{"}
	(or Pauli) effect associated with the compression of the metal wavefunction
	tails; and (c) the molecular dipoles. We argue that the ICT-model
	can be described as a limiting case of the unified IDIS-model for
	weak interface screening. For a fully quantitative understanding
	of the band alignment at organic interfaces{,} use of DFT (density
	functional theory) or quantum chemistry methods is highly desirable.
	In this Perspective review{,} we concentrate our discussion on DFT
	and show that conventional LDA or GGA calculations are limited by
	the {"}energy gap problem of the organic materials{"}{,} because
	the LDA (or GGA) Kohn-Sham energy levels have to be corrected by
	the self-interaction energy of the corresponding wavefunction{,}

	and polarization effects at MO interfaces tend to cancel these self-interaction
	corrections; in particular{,} we show that for organic molecules
	lying flat on Cu and Ag{,} these cancellations are so strong that
	we can rely on conventional DFT to calculate their interface properties.
	For Au{,} however{,} the cancellations are weaker making it necessary
	to go beyond conventional DFT. We discuss several alternatives beyond
	conventional LDA or GGA. The most accurate approach is the well-known
	GW-technique{,} but its use is limited by its high demanding computer
	time. In a very simple approach one can combine conventional DFT
	with a {"}scissor{"} operator which incorporates self-interaction
	corrections and polarization effects in the organic energy levels.
	Hybrid potentials combined with conventional DFT represent{,} probably{,}
	the best alternative for having a simple and accurate approach for

	spatial integration over an atomic domain to get rid of basis set

	method of calculating energies of excited states in order to make

	The DeltaSCF approximation is a density-functional method closely
	resembling standard density-functional theory (DFT), the only difference
	being that in DeltaSCF one or more electrons are placed in higher
	lying Kohn-Sham orbitals instead of placing all electrons in the
	lowest possible orbitals as one does when calculating the ground-state
	energy within standard DFT. We extend the DeltaSCF method by allowing
	excited electrons to occupy orbitals which are linear combinations
	of Kohn-Sham orbitals. With this extra freedom it is possible to
	place charge locally on adsorbed molecules in the calculations, such
	that resonance energies can be estimated, which is not possible in
	traditional DeltaSCF because of very delocalized Kohn-Sham orbitals.
	The method is applied to N2, CO, and NO adsorbed on different metallic
	surfaces and compared to ordinary DeltaSCF without our modification,
	spatially constrained DFT, and inverse-photoemission spectroscopy
	measurements. This comparison shows that the modified DeltaSCF method
	gives results in close agreement with experiment, significantly closer
	than the comparable methods. For N2 adsorbed on ruthenium (0001)
	we map out a two-dimensional part of the potential energy surfaces
	in the ground state and the 2pi resonance. From this we conclude
	that an electron hitting the resonance can induce molecular motion,
	optimally with 1.5 eV transferred to atomic movement. Finally we
	present some performance test of the DeltaSCF approach on gas-phase
	N2 and CO in order to compare the results to higher accuracy methods.
	Here we find that excitation energies are approximated with accuracy
	close to that of time-dependent density-functional theory. Especially
	we see very good agreement in the minimum shift of the potential
	energy surfaces in the excited state compared to the ground state.},

	M. Kuznetsov on his 65th birthday</ce:title>. The present paper gives
	an elaborate theoretical description of a new molecular charge transport
	mechanism applying to a single molecule trapped between two macroscopic
	electrodes in a solid state device. It is shown by a Hubbard type
	model of the electronic and electrostatic interactions, that the
	close proximity of metal electrodes may allow electrons to tunnel
	from the electrode directly into very localized image charge stabilized
	states on the molecule. Due to this mechanism, an exceptionally large
	number of redox states may be visited within an energy scale which
	would normally not allow the molecular HOMO-LUMO gap to be transversed.
	With a reasonable set of parameters, a good fit to recent experimental
	values may be obtained. The theoretical model is furthermore used
	to search for the physical boundaries of this effect, and it is found
	that a rather narrow geometrical space is available for the new mechanism
	to work: in the specific case of oligophenylenevinylene molecules
	recently explored in such devices several atoms in the terminal benzene
	rings need to be at van der Waal's distance to the electrode in order
	for the mechanism to work. The model predicts, that chemisorption
	of the terminal benzene rings too gold electrodes will impede the
	image charge effect very significantly because the molecule is pushed
	away from the electrode by the covalent thiol-gold bond.},

  abstract = {A set of successively more accurate self-consistent equations for
	the one-electron Green's function have been derived. They correspond
	to an expansion in a screened potential rather than the bare Coulomb
	potential. The first equation is adequate for many purposes. Each
	equation follows from the demand that a corresponding expression
	for the total energy be stationary with respect to variations in
	the Green's function. The main information to be obtained, besides
	the total energy, is one-particle-like excitation spectra, i.e.,
	spectra characterized by the quantum numbers of a single particle.
	This includes the low-excitation spectra in metals as well as configurations
	in atoms, molecules, and solids with one electron outside or one
	electron missing from a closed-shell structure. In the latter cases
	we obtain an approximate description by a modified Hartree-Fock equation
	involving a "Coulomb hole" and a static screened potential in the
	exchange term. As an example, spectra of some atoms are discussed.
	To investigate the convergence of successive approximations for the
	Green's function, extensive calculations have been made for the electron
	gas at a range of metallic densities. The results are expressed in
	terms of quasiparticle energies E(k) and quasiparticle interactions
	f(k, k′). The very first approximation gives a good value for the
	magnitude of E(k). To estimate the derivative of E(k) we need both
	the first- and the second-order terms. The derivative, and thus the
	specific heat, is found to differ from the free-particle value by
	only a few percent. Our correction to the specific heat keeps the
	same sign down to the lowest alkali-metal densities, and is smaller
	than those obtained recently by Silverstein and by Rice. Our results
	for the paramagnetic susceptibility are unreliable in the alkali-metal-density
	region owing to poor convergence of the expansion for f. Besides
	the proof of a modified Luttinger-Ward-Klein variational principle
	and a related self-consistency idea, there is not much new in principle
	in this paper. The emphasis is on the development of a numerically
	manageable approximation scheme.},

	The distance over which a molecular junction can be stretched before

	junction approach as a function of stretching rate. At low stretching
	rates, the stretching distance is small and independent of stretching
	rate. Above a certain stretching rate, it increases linearly with
	the logarithm of stretching rate. At very high stretching rates,
	the stretching distance reaches another plateau and becomes insensitive
	to the stretching rate again. The three regimes are well described
	by a thermodynamic bond-breaking model. A comparative study of Au-Au
	atomic point contacts indicates that the breakdown of the molecular
	junctions takes place at Au-Au bonds near the molecule-electrode
	contact. By fitting the experimental data with the model, the lifetime
	and binding energy were extracted. Both quantities are found to have
	broad distributions, owing to large variations in the molecule-electrode
	contact geometry. Although the molecular junctions are short-lived

	Several types of stochastic fluctuations were observed in the conductance

  abstract = {This thesis addresses the electronic structure of single-molecule
	nanojunctions.
	
	Over the past decade the experimental field of single-molecule electronics
	
	has progressed tremendously. This has led to the realization of the
	
	single-molecule version of the field effect transistor. Due to a weak
	coupling
	
	between the molecule and the metal electrodes, these single-molecule
	transistor
	
	function similarly to single-electron transistors. The theoretical
	understanding
	
	of single-molecule junctions is, however, far from complete. Due
	
	to their small size, Coulomb interactions between the charge carriers
	on the
	
	molecule and polarization charges in the neighboring junction environment
	
	plays an important role for their fundamental properties.
	
	A theoretical framework taking into account this effect is developed.
	It
	
	is based on an continuum electrostatic description of the junction
	combined
	
	with a quantum mechanical description of the molecule. The main result
	
	is an effective Hamiltonian for the molecule in which the junction
	is represented
	
	by its electrostatic potential. Hence, the solution to Poisson’s equation
	
	for a given junction geometry is an important part of this approach.
	The
	
	framework is readily integrated into existing implementations of standard
	
	electronic structure methods.
	
	In the present work a semi-empirical implementation of the approach
	has
	
	been applied to study polarization effects in a realistic single-molecule
	transistor.
	
	The Coulomb interaction between the molecule and the environment is
	
	demonstrated to alter the molecular electronic structure significantly.
	This is
	
	in agreement with experimental observations on single-molecule transistors.
	
	Furthermore, some general properties related to the electrostatic
	potential in
	
	single-molecule junctions are addressed.
	
	Similar polarization effects can be expected to play a role for the
	electronic
	
	structure of metal-molecule interfaces where the molecule is chemically
	
	bonded to the surface. Theoretical descriptions of such interfaces
	are however
	
	complicated by the bonding between the surface and the molecule. A
	
	many-body description which treats the molecule and the surface on
	equal
	
	footing is one possible approach. The Green’s function based GW method
	
	belongs to this type of methods. Recent theoretical first-principles
	studies of
	
	molecules on surfaces have demonstrated that GW gives a qualitative
	correct
	
	description of the molecular levels when physisorbed on metallic and
	dielectric
	
	surfaces. It is therefore important to know how well GW describes
	the
	
	electronic structure of isolated molecules. A benchmark study comparing
	
	GW with exact results for semi-empirical model descriptions of molecules
	
	is here given. It shows that GW gives a consistent and good description
	
	of molecular levels. In conjunction with the fact that surface polarization
	
	effects are included in GW, this makes the GW method well suited for
	the
	
	study of metal-molecule interfaces.},

	single-molecule transistor operating in the Coulomb blockade regime.
	This results in the appearance of a so-called blocking state, which

	the appearance of NDR and its magnitude in the symmetry-broken benzene
	SET depends in a complicated way on the interplay between the many-body
	matrix elements, the lead tunnel coupling asymmetry, and the bias
	polarity. In particular, the current reducing property of the blocking

	different bonding configurations corresponding to local energy minima

  abstract = {In this paper we will discuss relativistic total energies using the
	zeroth order regular approximation (ZORA). A simple scaling of the
	ZORA one-electron Hamiltonian is shown to yield energies for the
	hydrogenlike atom that are exactly equal to the Dirac energies. The
	regular approximation is not gauge invariant in each order, but the
	scaled ZORA energy can be shown to be exactly gauge invariant for
	hydrogenic ions. It is practically gauge invariant for many-electron
	systems and proves superior to the (unscaled) first order regular
	approximation for atomic ionization energies. The regular approximation,
	if scaled, can therefore be applied already in zeroth order to molecular
	bond energies. Scalar relativistic density functional all-electron
	and frozen core calculations on diatomics, consisting of copper,
	silver, and gold and their hydrides are presented. We used exchange-correlation
	energy functionals commonly used in nonrelativistic calculations;
	both in the local-density approximation (LDA) and including density-gradient
	(-nonlocal'') corrections (NLDA). At the NLDA level the calculated
	dissociation energies are all within 0.2 eV from experiment, with
	an average of 0.1 eV. All-electron calculations for Au2 and AuH gave
	results within 0.05 eV of the frozen core calculations.},

	It indicates that the elastic properties of the substrate facilitate

	spreading electrons more uniformly among the available packets, and
	thus reducing the noise below that of the classical shot-noise expression
	for totally uncorrelated electrons. After a brief review of the results
	for one-dimensional leads, we treat the case of the sample attached
	to two multichannel leads. A proper choice of basis for the wave
	packets permits this case to be reduced to that of a set of independent
	parallel one-channel samples. This picture is extended to the case
	of excess noise in multiterminal samples at zero temperature, leading
	to anticorrelated fluctuations between different leads. The anticorrelated
	fluctuations are analyzed, in particular detail for a Y-shaped three-lead
	sample. Our wave-packet approach is presented as a physically intuitive
	alternative to the existing approaches to mesoscopic noise, and leads
	to identical results.},

  year = {2009},
  abstract = {Nowadays nanotechnology allows to scale-down various important devices
	(sensors, chips, fibres, etc), and, thus, opens up new horizon for
	their applications. Nevertheless, the efficiency most of them is
	still based on the fundamental physical phenomena, such as resonances.
	Thus, the understanding of the resonance phenomena will be beneficial.
	One of the well-known examples is the resonant enhancement of the
	transmission known as Breit-Wigner resonances, which can be described
	by a Lorentzian function. But, in many physical systems the scattering
	of waves involves propagation along different paths, and, as a consequence,
	results in interference phenomena, where constructive interference
	corresponds to resonant enhancement and destructive interference
	to resonant suppression of the transmission. Recently, a variety
	of experimental and theoretical work has revealed such patterns in
	different branches of physics. The purpose of this Review is to demonstrate
	that this kind of resonant scattering is related to the Fano resonances,
	known from atomic physics. One of the main features of the Fano resonances
	is the asymmetric profile. The asymmetry comes from the close coexistence
	of resonant transmission and resonant reflection. Fano successfully
	explained such a phenomenon in his seminal paper in 1961 in terms
	of interaction of a discrete (localized) state with a continuum of
	propagation modes. It allows to describe both resonant enhancement
	and resonant suppression in a unified manner. All of these properties
	can be demonstrated in the frame of a very simple model, which will
	be used throughout the Review to show that resonant reflections observed
	in different complex systems are indeed closely related to the Fano
	resonances.}

  abstract = {Electronic excitations lie at the origin of most of the commonly measured
	spectra. However, the first-principles computation of excited states
	requires a larger effort than ground-state calculations, which can
	be very efficiently carried out within density-functional theory.
	On the other hand, two theoretical and computational tools have come
	to prominence for the description of electronic excitations. One
	of them, many-body perturbation theory, is based on a set of Green's-function
	equations, starting with a one-electron propagator and considering
	the electron-hole Green's function for the response. Key ingredients
	are the electron's self-energy Σ and the electron-hole interaction.
	A good approximation for Σ is obtained with Hedin's GW approach,
	using density-functional theory as a zero-order solution. First-principles
	GW calculations for real systems have been successfully carried out
	since the 1980s. Similarly, the electron-hole interaction is well
	described by the Bethe-Salpeter equation, via a functional derivative
	of Σ. An alternative approach to calculating electronic excitations
	is the time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT), which offers
	the important practical advantage of a dependence on density rather
	than on multivariable Green's functions. This approach leads to a
	screening equation similar to the Bethe-Salpeter one, but with a
	two-point, rather than a four-point, interaction kernel. At present,
	the simple adiabatic local-density approximation has given promising
	results for finite systems, but has significant deficiencies in the
	description of absorption spectra in solids, leading to wrong excitation
	energies, the absence of bound excitonic states, and appreciable
	distortions of the spectral line shapes. The search for improved
	TDDFT potentials and kernels is hence a subject of increasing interest.
	It can be addressed within the framework of many-body perturbation
	theory: in fact, both the Green's functions and the TDDFT approaches
	profit from mutual insight. This review compares the theoretical
	and practical aspects of the two approaches and their specific numerical
	implementations, and presents an overview of accomplishments and
	work in progress.},

	Green’s function method and the density-functional theory. We analyze
	the effects of bonding type, molecular orientation, and geometry
	relaxation on the electronic properties and charge and spin transport
	across the single-molecule junction. We consider nine interface geometries
	leading to five bonding mechanisms and two molecular orientations:
	(i) Au-C bonding, (ii) Au-Au bonding, (iii) Au-S bonding, (iv) Au-H
	bonding, and (v) physisorption via van der Waals forces. The two
	molecular orientations of Mn12 correspond to the magnetic easy axis
	of the molecule aligned perpendicular [hereafter denoted as orientation
	(1)] or parallel [orientation (2)] to the direction of electron transport.
	We find that the electron transport is carried by the lowest unoccupied
	molecular orbital (LUMO) level in all the cases that we have simulated.
	Relaxation of the junction geometries mainly shifts the relevant
	occupied molecular levels toward the Fermi energy as well as slightly
	reduces the broadening of the LUMO level. As a result, the current
	slightly decreases at low bias voltage. Our calculations also show
	that placing the molecule in the orientation (1) broadens the LUMO
	level much more than in the orientation (2) due to the internal structure
	of the Mn12. Consequently, junctions with the former orientation
	yield a higher current than those with the latter. Among all of the
	bonding types considered, the Au-C bonding gives rise to the highest
	current (about one order of magnitude higher than the Au-S bonding),
	for a given distance between the electrodes. The current through
	the junction with other bonding types decreases in the order of Au-Au,
	Au-S, and Au-H. Importantly, the spin-filtering effect in all the
	nine geometries stays robust and their ratios of the majority-spin
	to the minority-spin transmission coefficients are in the range of
	103–108. The general trend in transport among the different bonding
	types and molecular orientations obtained from this study may be
	applicable to other single-molecule magnets.},

  abstract = {The exact density functional for the ground-state energy is strictly
	self-interaction-free (i.e., orbitals demonstrably do not self-interact),
	but many approximations to it, including the local-spin-density (LSD)
	approximation for exchange and correlation, are not. We present two
	related methods for the self-interaction correction (SIC) of any
	density functional for the energy; correction of the self-consistent
	one-electron potenial follows naturally from the variational principle.
	Both methods are sanctioned by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. Although
	the first method introduces an orbital-dependent single-particle
	potential, the second involves a local potential as in the Kohn-Sham
	scheme. We apply the first method to LSD and show that it properly
	conserves the number content of the exchange-correlation hole, while
	substantially improving the description of its shape. We apply this
	method to a number of physical problems, where the uncorrected LSD
	approach produces systematic errors. We find systematic improvements,
	qualitative as well as quantitative, from this simple correction.
	Benefits of SIC in atomic calculations include (i) improved values
	for the total energy and for the separate exchange and correlation
	pieces of it, (ii) accurate binding energies of negative ions, which
	are wrongly unstable in LSD, (iii) more accurate electron densities,
	(iv) orbital eigenvalues that closely approximate physical removal
	energies, including relaxation, and (v) correct longrange behavior
	of the potential and density. It appears that SIC can also remedy
	the LSD underestimate of the band gaps in insulators (as shown by
	numerical calculations for the rare-gas solids and CuCl), and the
	LSD overestimate of the cohesive energies of transition metals. The
	LSD spin splitting in atomic Ni and s-d interconfigurational energies
	of transition elements are almost unchanged by SIC. We also discuss
	the admissibility of fractional occupation numbers, and present a
	parametrization of the electron-gas correlation energy at any density,
	based on the recent results of Ceperley and Alder.},

	in our understanding on how spins can be injected{,} manipulated

	named Spintronics. Recently a number of pioneering experiments and
	theoretical works suggest that organic materials can offer similar
	and perhaps superior performances in making spin-devices than the
	more conventional inorganic metals and semiconductors. Furthermore
	they can pave the way for radically new device concepts. This is
	Molecular Spintronics{,} a blossoming research area aimed at exploring
	how the unique properties of the organic world can marry the requirements
	of spin-devices. Importantly{,} after a first phase{,} where most
	of the research was focussed on exporting the concepts of inorganic
	spintronics to organic materials{,} the field has moved to a more
	mature age{,} where the exploitation of the unique properties of
	molecules has begun to emerge. Molecular spintronics now collects
	a diverse and interdisciplinary community ranging from device physicists

  abstract = { We theoretically investigate the charge and spin transport through
	a binuclear FeIIIFeIII iron complex connected to two metallic electrodes.
	During the transport process, the FeIIIFeIII dimer undergoes a one-electron
	reduction (Coulomb blockade transport regime), leading to the reduced
	mixed-valence FeII FeIII species. For such a system, the additional
	electron may be fully delocalized leading to the stabilization of
	the highest spin ground state S = 9/2 by the double exchange mechanism,
	while the original FeIIIFeIII has usually an S = 0 spin ground state
	due to the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between the two FeIII
	ions. Intuitively, the spin delocalization within the mixed-valence
	complex may be thought to favor charge and spin transport through
	the molecule between the two metallic electrodes. Contrary to such
	an intuitive concept, we find that the increased delocalization leads
	in fact to a blocking of the transport, if the exchange coupling
	interaction within the FeIIIFeIII dimer is antiferromagnetic. This
	is due to the violation of the spin angular momentum conservation,
	where a change of half a unit of spin (ΔS = 1/2) is allowed between
	two different redox states of the molecule. The result is explained
	in terms of a double-exchange blockade mechanism, triggered by the
	interplay between spin delocalization and antiferromagnetic coupling
	between the magnetic cores. Consequently, ferromagnetically coupled
	dimers are shown not to be affected by the double-exchange blockade
	mechanism. The situation is evocative of the onset and removal of
	giant magnetoresistance in the conductance of diamagnetic layers,
	as a function of the relative alignment of the magnetization of two
	weakly antiferromagnetically coupled ferromagnetic contacts. Numerical
	simulations accounting for the effect of vibronic coupling show that
	the spin current increases as a function of spin delocalization in
	Class I and Class II mixed-valence dimers. The signature of vibronic
	coupling on sequential spin-tunneling processes through Class I and
	Class II mixed-valence systems is identified and discussed. },

	Despite a more involved formulation, this partition-free approach

	we clarify under what circumstances a steady-state current develops

	in our understanding of the conducting properties of mesoscopic systems.
	It is shown that in the absence of a magnetic field, the formula
	proposed by Büttiker, which expresses the current response of a multi-port
	conductor in terms of transmission matrices, is derivable straightforwardly
	from linear response theory. We also present a general formalism
	for solving these equations for the resistance given the scattering
	matrix. This Landauer-type formula reduces to g=(e2/h)Tr(tt†), where
	g is the conductance and t is the transmission matrix, for the two-probe
	case. It is suggested that this formula provides the best description
	of the present class of experiments performed in two-probe or multi-probe
	measuring configurations, and that the subtleties leading to various
	different Landauer formulae are not relevant to these experiments.
	This is not because of the large number of channels in real conductors,
	but is due to the fact that apparently no present experiment probes
	a "local chemical potential" in the conductor. Certain standard objections
	to deriving a Landauer-type formula from linear response theory are
	answered. Applications of this formula to fluctuations in disordered
	multi-probe conductors are discussed.},

  abstract = {A surface-adsorbed molecule is contacted with the tip of a scanning

	the molecule is peeled off the surface. During this experiment, a
	two-dimensional differential conductance map is measured on the plane
	spanned by the bias voltage and the tip-surface distance. The conductance
	map demonstrates that tip retraction leads to mechanical gating of
	the molecular wire in the STM junction. The experiments are compared
	with a detailed ab initio simulation. We find that density functional
	theory (DFT) in the local density approximation (LDA) describes the
	tip-molecule contact formation and the geometry of the molecular
	junction throughout the peeling process with predictive power. However,
	a DFT-LDA-based transport simulation following the nonequilibrium
	Green's function (NEGF) formalism fails to describe the behavior
	of the differential conductance as found in experiment. Further analysis
	reveals that this failure is due to the mean-field description of
	electron correlation in the local density approximation. The results
	presented here are expected to be of general validity and show that,
	for a wide range of common wire configurations, simulations which
	go beyond the mean-field level are required to accurately describe
	current conduction through molecules. Finally, the results of the
	present study illustrate that well-controlled experiments and concurrent
	ab initio transport simulations that systematically sample a large
	configuration space of molecule-electrode couplings allow the unambiguous

	and molecular eigenstates is large, transport occurs largely by elastic
	tunneling, stochastic switching is common, and the vibronic signature
	can be found using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS).
	As the energy gaps for injection become smaller, one begins to see
	stronger molecular signatures - these include Franck-Condon-like
	structures in the current/voltage characteristic and strong vibronic
	interactions, which can lead to hopping behavior at the polaron limit.
	Conformational changes induced by the strong electric field lead
	to another strong manifestation of the molecular nature of the junction.

	wave functions, is calculated using a many-body linear combination
	of atomic orbitals Hamiltonian, whereby electron long-range interactions
	are obtained using an expansion in the metal/organic wave function
	overlap, while the electronic charge of both materials remains unchanged.
	This approach yields the pillow dipole and represents the first effect
	induced by the metal/organic interaction, resulting in a reduction
	of the metal work function. In a second step, we consider how charge
	is transferred between the metal and the organic material by means
	of the IDIS model: Charge transfer is determined by the relative
	position of the metal work function (corrected by the pillow effect)
	and the organic charge neutrality level, as well as by an interface
	parameter S, which measures how this potential difference is screened.
	In our approach, we show that the combined IDIS-pillow effects can
	be described in terms of the original IDIS alignment corrected by
	a screened pillow dipole. For the organic materials considered in
	this paper, we see that the IDIS dipole already represents most of
	the realignment induced at the metal/organic interface. We therefore
	conclude that the pillow effect yields minor corrections to the IDIS

	was developed for B3LYP/6-31G(d) calculations and the uniform frequency
	scaling technique (DFT-UFS) was applied to B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) results.
	The DFT-SQM calculations have been previously compared with IR and
	Raman spectra with good agreement, which allows for a nearly complete
	vibrational assignment. The results of the present study extend previous
	vibrational analysis to a higher level of reliability and complexity.
	The previous results are augmented by the comparison of calculated
	and observed INS intensities and the comparison of calculated modes
	with those observed in INS spectra but previously unobserved in optical
	spectra. Excellent agreement is acquired between the INS spectra
	and the results of both calculations, permitting a more detailed
	and reliable description of the vibrational properties of porphyrins.

	The interaction of the electrons with antiparallel spin, contains,

  abstract = {Transport in molecular electronic devices is different from that in
	semiconductor mesoscopic devices in two important aspects: (1) the
	effect of the electronic structure and (2) the effect of the interface
	to the external contact. A rigorous treatment of molecular electronic
	devices will require the inclusion of these effects in the context
	of an open system exchanging particle and energy with the external
	environment. This calls for combining the theory of quantum transport
	with the theory of electronic structure starting from the first-principles.
	We present a self-consistent yet tractable matrix Green's function
	(MGF) approach for studying transport in molecular electronic devices,
	based on the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism of quantum
	transport and the density functional theory (DFT) of electronic structure
	using local orbital basis sets. By separating the device rigorously
	(within an effective single-particle theory) into the molecular region
	and the contact region, we can take full advantage of the natural
	spatial locality associated with the metallic screening in the electrodes
	and focus on the physical processes in the finite molecular region.
	This not only opens up the possibility of using the existing well-established
	technique of molecular electronic structure theory in transport calculations
	with little change, but also allows us to use the language of qualitative
	molecular orbital theory to interpret and rationalize the results
	of the computation. We emphasize the importance of the self-consistent
	charge transfer and voltage drop on the transport characteristics
	and describe the self-consistent formulation for both device at equilibrium
	and device out of equilibrium. For the device at equilibrium, our
	method provides an alternative approach for solving the molecular
	chemisorption problem. For the device out of equilibrium, we show
	that the calculation of elastic current transport through molecules,
	both conceptually and computationally, is no more difficult than
	solving the chemisorption problem.},

	transport through individual molecules with metallic contacts. We
	view the molecules as “heterostructures” composed of chemically well-defined
	atomic groups, and analyze the device characteristics in terms of
	the charge and potential response of these atomic groups to the perturbation
	induced by the metal-molecule coupling and the applied bias voltage,
	which are modeled using a first-principles based self-consistent
	matrix Green’s function (SCMGF) method. As the first example, we
	examine the devices formed by attaching two benzene-based molecular
	radicals—phenyl dithiol (PDT) and biphenyl dithiol (BPD)—symmetrically
	onto two semi-infinite gold electrodes through the end sulfur atoms.
	We find that both molecules acquire a fractional number of electrons
	with similar magnitude and spatial distribution upon contact with
	the electrodes. The charge transfer creates a potential barrier at
	the metal-molecule interface that modifies significantly the frontier
	molecular states depending on the corresponding electron density
	distribution. For both molecules, the metal Fermi level is found
	to lie closer to the highest-occupied-molecular-orbital (HOMO) than
	to the lowest-unoccupied-molecular-orbital (LUMO). Transmission in
	the HOMO-LUMO gap for both molecules is due to the metal-induced
	gap states arising from the hybridization of the metal surface states
	with the occupied molecular states. Applying a finite bias voltage
	leads to only minor net charge injection due to the symmetric device
	structure assumed in this work. But as current flows, the electrons
	within the molecular junction redistribute substantially, with resistivity
	dipoles developing in the vicinity of potential barriers. Only the
	delocalized π electrons in the benzene ring can effectively screen
	the applied electric field. For the PDT molecule, the majority of
	the bias voltage drops at the metal-molecule interface. But for the
	BPD molecule, a significant amount of the voltage also drops in the
	molecule core. The field-induced modification of the molecular states
	(the static Stark effect) becomes significant as the bias voltage
	increases beyond the linear-transport region. A bias-induced reduction
	of the HOMO-LUMO gap is observed for both molecules at large bias.
	The Stark effect is found to be stronger for the BPD molecule than
	the PDT molecule despite the longer length of the former. For both
	molecules, the peaks in the conductance are due to electron transmission
	through the occupied rather than the unoccupied molecular states.
	The calculation is done at room temperature, and we find that the
	thermionic-emission contribution to the current-voltage characteristics
	of both molecules is negligible.},

	between the modified metal-molecule coupling and the corresponding
	modified energy level lineup at the molecular junction. Due to the
	close proximity of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)

	to the counterintuitive increase of conductance with increasing top-metal–molecule
	distance that decreases only after the energy level line up saturates

	the effect on molecular transport from adding an apex atom onto the
	surface of a semi-infinite electrode is similar to that from increasing
	the metal-molecule distance. The similarity is reflected in both
	the charge and potential response of the molecular junction and consequently
